"# sjcnoise" 

If you live in Sunnyvale, Cuperetino, or Mountain View and are bothered by the newly concentrated SJC south flow flights, you can file complaints against those flights using this tool. It is hosted by Google App Engine since its inception in Feb. 2017:

https://sjcnoise.appspot.com

This tool is a volunteering work for savemysunnysky.org and the communities impacted by the SJC flight noise in the above cities. On many south flow days (with south winds), the tool is used 400+ times per day by residents in the communities.

The tool extracts flight information from overheadairplanes.com, which was made available by other volunteers of savemysunnysky.org.

Thank you for using this tool!
